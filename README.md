# C4-GR4SS-Piano-demo
Piano activity demo for the GR4SS Rehab app for stroke survivors

The demo was for my final year C4 Capstone presentation.

This is an activity of a piano made based on wireframes from figma with the first and second lines of the Qwerty keypasd as the keys. This is done in accordance of Fitts law in Human centered Design where the person doesnt have to move far form the home button to the target button.This Activity also makes it simple for stroke survivors to use their fingers and not make it extremely difficult for them to move.
In built feature of hiding the key tags so after usage for a certain amount of time the user can play a sequence on command and stimulate their memory and cognitive abiltities as well. 

The goal of the activity is to improve the stroke survivors tactile rerponse, cognition and motor skills.

Made using javascript, css, html starndard libraries for the piano notes.
